## 📚 Research Objectives

- Archaeological excavation reports hold vast knowledge, yet remain largely unstructured.  
- Heripo treats this not as a technical problem, but as a structural constraint of research practice.  
- The group transforms excavation records into structured, verifiable data without losing source context.  
- Technology supports research practice — interpretation and judgment remain with researchers.  
- Heripo builds a sustainable research infrastructure for comparative and cumulative archaeology.

## ⚙️ Data Design Principles

Heripo adopts a layered data model that separates documentation, data extraction, standardization, and interpretation:

1. Document Structure Extraction — Preserve chapters, tables, figures, and images as-is.  
2. Archaeological Data Ledger — Record facts in a source-faithful, immutable form.  
3. Standardization — Apply standards selectively depending on research goals.  
4. Ontology — Define semantic relations for cross-site comparison and analysis.  

This separation ensures authenticity, traceability, and academic verifiability.
